## **This is an offline version of PolyMC that lets you play the game without a Mojang account.**
### This fork reimplements Pull Request [#50](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/pull/50) by @bexnoss to readd this feature.

#### This software is not related to PolyMC developers. **Don't create issues on the original repository if something goes wrong.**

## Pre-built binaries:
- Windows / Linux / MacOS: https://nightly.link/lebestnoob/PolyMC-Offline/workflows/main/develop

[![CI](https://github.com/lebestnoob/PolyMC/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lebestnoob/PolyMC/actions/workflows/main.yml)

To update the launcher replace all replaceable files and folders with the newer one from the above link.

In case you are using MacOS/Linux then an additional step may be required to make the launcher executable. You can make it executable by using the command `chmod +x polymc` in the terminal.

# Details about the ORIGINAL launcher below:

PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

This is a **fork** of the MultiMC Launcher and not endorsed by MultiMC. The PolyMC community felt that the maintainer was not acting in the spirit of Free Software so this fork was made.

An RPM package is available on [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/polymc/polymc/).

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable polymc/polymc
sudo dnf install polymc
```

Alternatively, a COPR maintained by a PolyMC user (instead of Jenkins' automated builds) is available [here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sentry/polymc).

### <img src="https://lotar.altervista.org/wiki/_media/news/slackware-logo.png" height="20" /> Slackware

[A SlackBuild](https://codeberg.org/glowiak/SlackBuilds/src/branch/master/repository/polymc.md) is available. You will need [qt5](http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.2/libraries/qt5/) (on 15.0 installed by default), [a JDK](https://codeberg.org/glowiak/SlackBuilds/src/branch/master/repository/adoptium-jdk8.md), and if you're on 14.2, you need to compile newer CMake version manually. To build, type in extracted directory with all dependiences met:

    sudo ./polymc.SlackBuild
    sudo installpkg /tmp/polymc-version-arch-1_SBo.tgz

If you are too lazy to do all these steps, you can just download [a prebuild x86_64 package](http://glowiak.github.io/file/polymc-latest-slackware) and install it with /sbin/installpkg:

    sudo /sbin/installpkg ~/Downloads/polymc-version-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz

## <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/microsoft/microsoft-icon.svg" height="20" /> Windows

[Windows (32-bit)](https://packages.polymc.org/latest/win32/win32.zip) ([SHA256](https://packages.polymc.org/latest/win32/win32.zip.sha256)) - this is a portable package, you can extract it anywhere and run it. This package needs testing.

## <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/apple/apple-tile.svg" height="20" /> MacOS

MacOS currently does not have any packages. We are still working on setting up MacOS packaging. Meanwhile, you can [build](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/blob/develop/BUILD.md#macos) it for yourself.

## <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/freebsd/freebsd-icon.svg" height="20" /> FreeBSD

For FreeBSD available are:

- [AppBSD Image](http://glowiak.github.io/file/polymc-latest-fbsd64-appbsd) - a portable application, requires [AppBSD](https://codeberg.org/glowiak/appbsd/) to be installed.

- [Gzipped binaries](http://glowiak.github.io/file/polymc-latest-fbsd64-raw) - traditional way to distribute, unpack and run.

In both cases you need X11, Qt5 and Java installed. Both files are 64bit only.

## <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AliasIO/wappalyzer/master/src/drivers/webextension/images/icons/OpenBSD%20httpd.svg" height="20" /> OpenBSD

For OpenBSD available are [gzipped 32-bit binaries](http://glowiak.github.io/file/polymc-latest-obsd32-raw), download, unpack and run.

You need X11, Qt5 and Java installed.

## Development Builds

There are per-commit development builds available [here](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/actions). These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.
Builds are provided for Linux, AppImage on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

# Help & Support

Feel free to create an issue if you need help. However, you might find it easier to ask in the Discord server.

[![PolyMC Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/923671181020766230?label=PolyMC%20Discord)](https://discord.gg/xq7fxrgtMP)

For people who don't want to use Discord, we have a Matrix Space which is bridged to the Discord server:

If there are any issues with the space or you are using a client that does not support the feature here are the individual rooms:

# Development

If you want to contribute to PolyMC you might find it useful to join our Discord Server or Matrix Space.

## Building

If you want to build PolyMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:

- Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
- Prefer readability over dogma.
- Keep to the existing formatting.
- Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
- Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.

## Translations

The translation effort for PolyMC is hosted on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/polymc/polymc/) and information about translating PolyMC is available at https://github.com/PolyMC/Translations
