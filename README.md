## This repository has been archived.

### This fork reverts commit `e0a04c50316089b9a443355394c5babf39a1771d` on pull request [#113](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/pull/113) by [@NyaomiDEV](https://github.com/NyaomiDEV) to implement offline accounts.

PolyMC-Offline is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity. **This is an offline version of PolyMC that lets you play the game without a Mojang account.**

This software is not related to PolyMC developers. **Don't create issues on the original repository if something goes wrong.**
This is a **fork** of the MultiMC Launcher and not endorsed by MultiMC. The PolyMC community felt that the maintainer was not acting in the spirit of Free Software so this fork was made.

# Help & Support

Feel free to create an issue if you need help.

## Building

If you want to build PolyMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

## Code formatting

Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:

- Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
- Prefer readability over dogma.
- Keep to the existing formatting.
- Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
- Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.
